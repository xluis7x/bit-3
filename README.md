## HarryPotterApp

This project is about consuming an API and creating a project with Angular, in this case I'll use [Harry Potter API](https://potterapi-fedeperin.vercel.app) and apply everything I've learn about Angular to create a responsive SPA (Single Page Application) about Harry Potter books, characters and almost or all API's information. 

I'll apply all my knowledge in previous topics; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, to keep improving my programming and software development skills.
